# ip_location

A macOS Menu Bar application displaying information about the device's current ip address.

## Getting Started

In order to run the app locally, an api key from [ipgeolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/) is required in [`lib/home_screen/ip_locator_key.dart`](lib/home_screen/ip_locator_key.dart):

```dart
const ipgeolocationKey = 'API_KEY';
```
